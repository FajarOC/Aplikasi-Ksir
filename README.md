## 🛠 Getting Started

The app has a React/Vite frontend and a FastAPI backend. You will need an OpenAI API key with access to the GPT-4 Vision API.

Run the backend (I use Poetry for package management - `pip install poetry` if you don't have it):

```bash
cd backend
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key" > .env
poetry install
poetry shell
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload --port 7001
```

Run the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn
yarn dev
```
